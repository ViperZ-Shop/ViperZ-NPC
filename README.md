Interaction with NPC

- To interact with the NPC you need to have a job that is not "police" or "ambulance", if you have one of those jobs, it will not let you interact with the NPC.

- When interacting with the NPC, you can buy some items from him (which are configurable, you can change them) or you can go talk to another Ped, who would be the Boss. You will only be able to talk to him if you press the option, otherwise, you will not be able to talk to him.

- With the Boss NPC, you can buy weapons from him.

- This is all, we will soon update this script to make it more complete.
